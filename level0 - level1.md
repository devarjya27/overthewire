# Level 0 -> Level 1
In this challenge we use the commands `ls` and `cat` to get the required passsword.
# My Solve
Firstly I did `ls` to list the files in the home directory. The only file there was `readme` so I simply did `cat readme` to read the file and then I got the password
```bash
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
readme
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme
